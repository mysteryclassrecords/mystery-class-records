Optimize Images for Web Use
Before adding images to your GitHub repo, optimize them to reduce file size while maintaining quality:
    Tools for Optimization:
        SVG: Use SVGOMG to clean and compress your SVGs.
        PNG/JPEG: Use TinyPNG to compress images.
        WEBP: Use Squoosh for advanced optimization.
    Why Optimize?
        Keeps your website loading quickly, especially on mobile devices.
        Reduces the size of your GitHub repository.

What Format Should You Use?
    Logos, Icons, and Simple Graphics: Stick with SVG (smallest size, scalable, and high quality).
    Images Without Transparency: Use JPEG (smaller size for complex graphics or photos).
    Images With Transparency: Use PNG (if you need transparency, but optimize for smaller file size).
    Advanced Optimization: Consider WEBP if file size is a concern and browser compatibility isn’t an issue.

To ensure a great mobile experience, you need to implement responsive web design techniques.

Quick Checklist for Mobile Responsiveness
✔ Use relative units (%, em, vw, etc.).
✔ Implement media queries for breakpoints.
✔ Test layouts using browser dev tools.
✔ Avoid fixed widths and large images.
✔ Use flexible layouts like Flexbox or CSS Grid.
✔ Make text and buttons easily readable and touch-friendly.
